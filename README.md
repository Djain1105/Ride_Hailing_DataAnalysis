# Ride_Hailing_DataAnalysis

The key aspect of ride-hailing (ex. Uber, Ola) is upfront pricing, which works in the following way:
First, it predicts the price for a ride based on predicted distance and time. This price is what you see on the screen of the phone before ordering a ride. 
Second, if the metered price based on actual distance and time differs a lot from the predicted one, the upfront price switches to the metered price.
No customer likes surprises (especially when it comes to money!), that’s why a company always strives to improve our upfront pricing precision for our customers’ smooth journeys.
The task is to analyze this data and identify the top 1 to 2 opportunities that can help us improve upfront pricing precision.
